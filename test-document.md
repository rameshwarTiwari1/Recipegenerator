# Recipe Card Generator - Test Document

## Initial Prompt Used
"Create a single-page web application that allows users to input recipe information and generates a styled, printable recipe card with the following requirements:
1. Input form with recipe name, prep/cook time, servings, dynamic ingredients list, and dynamic instructions
2. Live preview that updates in real-time
3. Print/Export feature that hides form elements
4. 2-3 different visual themes
5. Mobile responsive design
6. Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript only"

## Key Iterations and Refinements

1. **Added Three Distinct Themes**: Created Classic (serif with gradient), Modern (sleek with purple gradient), and Rustic (handwritten style with emoji) themes to give users variety in presentation.

2. **Enhanced Mobile Responsiveness**: Implemented CSS Grid that collapses to single column on mobile, optimized form layout for smaller screens, and ensured all interactive elements are touch-friendly.

3. **Improved Print Functionality**: Added comprehensive print media queries that hide all form elements and optimize the recipe card layout specifically for printing, ensuring only the recipe content appears on paper.

## Challenges Encountered and Resolutions

1. **Dynamic Input Management**: Initially struggled with event listener management for dynamically added ingredients/instructions. Resolved by implementing proper event delegation and cleanup functions.

2. **Theme Switching with Live Preview**: Ensured theme changes apply immediately to the preview card without requiring page refresh by using CSS classes and JavaScript event handlers.

3. **Print Layout Optimization**: Addressed print styling to ensure the recipe card prints cleanly without form elements, using CSS `@media print` queries and `display: none !important` for form sections.
